# DCT-JPEG-compression
Project for 'Discrete Dynamical Models'  course. The main topic is the Cosine Discrete Transform and, in particular, the JPEG compression algorithm is presented. A GUI on Matlab is implemented to perform it.

DCT-JPEG is the pdf file that resume the whole project explaining the theory on which relies the algorithm. 
simpleImageCompressorGUIcolor.m and grayscaleGUI.m are the two GUI that performs the algorithm. 
Compression.m is the algorithm. 
prato.jpg is a testing picture that can be used in all the Matlab codes.
